# üëó Fashion MNIST Classification Model

## üìñ Overview

This project involves building and deploying a machine learning model to classify fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras, with deployment handled via Streamlit for easy web-based interaction.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing and accessories. The objective of this project is to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## üîç Approach

1. **Loading Necessary Libraries and Dataset**  
   - Utilized essential Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Pandas.
   - Loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes training and test datasets.

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Visualized the dataset to understand the distribution and structure of the data.
   - Plotted sample images from each class to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalized the pixel values to fall within the range [0, 1] to improve model performance.
   - Reshaped and prepared the data to be fed into the neural network model.

4. **Model Building**  
   - Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras, designed to balance complexity and accuracy.
   - Implemented various layers such as Convolutional, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers to enhance the model's performance.
   - Focused on optimizing the model's accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Trained the model using the training dataset and validated its performance on the validation set.
   - Evaluated the model's accuracy and loss over training epochs to ensure robustness.

6. **Deployment Using Streamlit**  
   - Deployed the trained model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application.
   - The app allows users to upload images of clothing items and receive predictions on the category of the item.
   - Integrated user-friendly features such as image resizing, preprocessing, and real-time prediction display.
